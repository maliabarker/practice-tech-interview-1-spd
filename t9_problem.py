'''
Given a string of digits 2 to 9 a user has pressed on an 
old T9 telephone keypad, return a list of all possible 
letter combinations they could have been trying to type.

EXAMPLE 1:
t9_letters("23") â‡’ ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]

PSUEDOCODE/THOUGHT PROCESS:

My first though is that we need a way to keep track of the 
letters that are associated with each number. To make the 
lookup time for these letters constant, I would create a 
dictionary that stores keys as the numbers and values as 
a list of possible numbers.

From there, I would do the simple solution. 
For each number, I would want to grab the corresponding letter 
array and loop over that, so we'll have this crazy long sequence of lists to iterate over eseentially.
This would be O(n^n)
